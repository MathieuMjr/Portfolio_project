# PORTFOLIO PROJECT - HOLBERTON SCHOOL DIJON

This project is part the first year "Fundamentals" curriculum at Holberton School.

We were asked to imagine, design and develop a web application of our choice and to develop it.

This README describes **the different stages of my work** on this portfolio project, from `technical documentation` to code.

## INTRODUCTION :
### Purpose of the application:
This application offers an open-source solution for cultural organisations to manage their bookings.
### Problem statement:
Cultural organisations such as local museums and associations need sometimes some open-source or free-to-use solutions for economic reasons : they use several tools to manage their booking, analyze their audiences, generate invoices...

This application aims to bring together three main features : 
- booking scheduling, 
- automatic document generation based on scheduling informations (contracts, invoices...),
- data extraction for reporting purpose,

## TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION
### USERS STORIES

### MOCKUPS
### SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND TECHNOLOGY STACK
This application will follow a client-server monolithic 3 tiers logic architecture :
- a `front-end` interface that allow users to loggin and create, update and display the bookings;
- a `database` to save the bookings, structures, booking types, users, etc.
- a `back-end` exposing a RESTful API that receive user queries from the front-end to serve data
